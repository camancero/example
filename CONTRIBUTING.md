How to contribute
I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us in IRC (#opengovernment on freenode). We want you working on things you're excited about.

Here are some important resources:

OpenGovernment for Developers tells you where we are,
Our roadmap is the 10k foot view of where we're going, and
Pivotal Tracker is our day-to-day project management space.
Mailing list: Join our developer list
Bugs? Lighthouse is where to report them
IRC: chat.freenode.net channel #opengovernment. We're usually there during business hours.
Testing
We have a handful of Cucumber features, but most of our testbed consists of RSpec examples. Please write RSpec examples for new code you create.
